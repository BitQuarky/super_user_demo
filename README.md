## Super User Demo

Super User is a stealth and physics puzzle game with mechanics that allow the player to reprogram game mechanics. Itâ€™s currently in a WIP state and only a demo is provided in this release. The level is whiteboxed and incomplete, although unfinished parts of the map are accessible to the player in this demo version. Super User is free and open source, although there are plans to eventually move away from godot to a custom or code-based engine.

# Plot

You're an AI robot being trained to repair a facility and its electronic parts, 
but a system failure puts you on the wrong side of the cameras. 
Stealth your way through dark hallways and use your reprogramming training to manipulate surveillance drones and other obstacles. 
Lift the lockdown on the floor and escape.

# Future plans

This demo is in an early state and still needs plenty of work. There are plans to:
Add a menu with gamemodes/scenarios/levels
Add a procedurally generated roguelike mode
Add a mario-maker style online mode
Alternatively custom levels
Move to a code-based game engine like Bevy or a custom solution
Modding support
As always, add and improve content

# Poll

Super User was started as a research project to investigate mechanics that could interest players in game design and programming. If you download and play the demo please fill out the accompanying survey.

# Building

It's a regular godot project, so building and running is the same. However, if there are issues with missing dependencies, pull or clone again and run setup.sh (or manually copy addons folder from func_godot_plugin to the root directory)
